ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Hagen Fritz. I am pursuing my PhD in Civil Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. My research centers around how we can use consumer-grade indoor air quality sensors (IAQ) to assess research questions (see the repo on the [BEVO Beacon](https://github.com/intelligent-environments-lab/bevo_iaq)) such as how IAQ affects sleep quality (see our recent [publication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132322000828?casa_token=oz9yNPemU_kAAAAA:Ukqyr4ijYrDoIo9Mf5k-7XOECpwwB236eqvF6_nQIXmByX90ArJPTp0WPeNvbpKYm-ZbLxgu)).

I am currently learning about IoT devices, data engineering/science, machine learning, and the basics of a few different programming languages on my way to pursuing my interests. I recently accepted a position at [Rogers O'Brien](https://www.r-o.com/) where I plan to purse these interests and learn more about working in industry.


I am open to collaborating on anything so feel free to reach out to me at hagenfritz@utexas.edu.
